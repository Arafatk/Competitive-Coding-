Map 
Now you use map which keeps things in ordered form and this can keep both pairs strings 
and ints And it keeps data in ordered form with begin 
keeping the shortest they can be traversed 
iterators so now you use them to keep counts of things and also make sure that 
you are very careful while lowering counts as to not reome the begin of the map
to break the tree
Multi map can have multiple keys and when you traverse a map you must know 
that it is alread ordered
For Faster speed and hashing we might use trie and it would still be cool
Begin  -> returns the first element which is the smallest or largest if greater is used
swap   -> swaps the contents of two different maps

Very rare cases ask you to use unordered map in which you better use a trie 

Set 
Now multiset is the datastructure which is similar to
set and it keeps the data in the ordered form from low to higer
highet with multiset adding the feature of keeping identical elements
too and now the cool thing about multiset and set is the that the order
from incereasing can be changed to decreasing with greater feature

List 
It can be sorted,lists can be swapped between each other
Spliced puttin some part of one list inside another list to make things cool
Unique   removes all the consecutive equal elements
