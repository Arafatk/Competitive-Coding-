A cut vertex is a vertex that when removed (with its boundary edges) from a
graph creates more connected components than previously in the graph.
A cut edge is an edge that when removed (the vertices stay in place) from a graph 
creates more connected components than previously in the graph.
A single vertex is also considered connected to itself and when removing cut edges
you make sure you are not cutting out cycles
